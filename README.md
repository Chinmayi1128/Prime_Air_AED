# Problem Statement

Airways are widely regarded as the quickest means of delivering services to various organizations.
Specific organizations pay highly for the upkeep of air facilities, such as technicians, stations, and drivers.
There is a need for a single point of contact where various organizations can obtain fast air services at afforda* ble prices.


# Proposed Solution

To solve this problem, we came up with a solution which involves quadcopters and drones to assist the organisations in need.
As a result, a diverse range of organizations receive urgent and cost-effective air coverage at the most opportune times.
Our quadcopters are efficient enough to capture images, videos and even live video recording thus enabling an aid for different fields such as SWAT, Medical Organization, Fire Brigades or even private organizations.
